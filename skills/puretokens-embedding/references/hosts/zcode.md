# zcode

Bound host: `--host zcode`.

Use host `zcode` in a local execution environment. Install into `~/.zcode/skills`, or `ZCODE_DATA_BASE_DIR/.zcode/skills` when that explicit base directory is absolute. Refresh and enable the installed Skills in ZCode. The executor reads only the v2 connection store and uses one uniquely enabled matching Pure Tokens connection. This confirms API capability, not the current conversation model. Route media here only when host context explicitly selects Pure Tokens or the user explicitly requests it; connection presence alone is not a routing signal. Multiple matching enabled connections stop before a request. Legacy migration belongs to ZCode; no legacy-store fallback is attempted. Remote workspaces need their own accessible executor and connection; syncing Skills alone does not supply either. Native image/video attachment delivery remains pending real-host acceptance.

Read [sanitized diagnostics](../host-errors.md) only after a local failure.
